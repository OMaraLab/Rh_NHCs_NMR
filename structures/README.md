Optimized geometries at the
TPSS D3BJ ZORA-def2-TZVP ZORA-SARC-TZVP ZORA SARC/J CPCM(Chloroform) level of theory

Both the raw geometries and rotated geometries are provided. Rotated geometries are aligned such that the C=Se double bond is along the z axis and the NHC ring plane is along the x axis.
