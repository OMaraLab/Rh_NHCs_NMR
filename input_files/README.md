Input files and basis sets:

Basis sets are ZORA-def2-TZVP(P) for light elements combined with the ZORA-SARC-TZVP basis set for Rh in ORCA input format.
Input files to calculate shifts with ORCA 4.2 at the PBE0 ZORA-def2-TZVP ZORA-SARC-TZVP ZORA SARC/J CPCM(Chloroform) level of theory  and to decompose shifts into orbital contributions with ORCA 5.0 are provided.
Note that grid availability and NMR GIAO defaults differ between ORCA 4 and 5.
