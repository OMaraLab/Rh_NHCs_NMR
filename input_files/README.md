Input files and basis sets:

Basis sets are def2-TZVP(P) for light elements combined with the SARC basis set for Rh in ORCA input format.
Input files to calculate shifts with ORCA 4.2  and to decompose shifts into orbital contributions with ORCA 5.0 are provided.
Note that grid availability and NMR GIAO defaults differ between ORCA 4 and 5.
